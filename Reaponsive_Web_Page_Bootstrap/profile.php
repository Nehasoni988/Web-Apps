Unlike many superstars, Amitabh Bachchan saw failure at the peak of his career and struggled in a mature age as an actor and claimed back his throne of super-stardom in the second phase of his acting career.It is a little-known fact that in early life, Amitabh Bachchan, who aspired to become an actor, was rejected for his voice, gangly height and not having a ‘camera conducive face’. History is well-versed in irony because today, Amitabh Bachchan is known across India and the world at large for his baritone voice, commanding height and striking face.
